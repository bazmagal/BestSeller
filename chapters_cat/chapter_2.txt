# Chapter 2: Into the Depths

The ancient oak tree loomed before them, its gnarled branches creating intricate shadow patterns in the silver moonlight. Luna's whiskers twitched nervously as she circled the massive trunk, her paws silent on the dew-dampened earth.

"I don't see anything that looks like a cave entrance," she whispered, her tail flicking with anxiety.

Shelly had been moving steadily along the base of the tree, leaving a thin, glistening trail behind her. "Look closer, Luna. The old magic is subtle—it hides in plain sight."

Luna crouched low, her keen feline eyes scanning every crevice and root hollow. Then she saw it: what appeared to be merely a shadow between two massive roots shimmered slightly, like heat waves on summer pavement.

"There!" she breathed, padding closer. As she approached, the shadow seemed to deepen, revealing itself as an opening just wide enough for a cat to squeeze through. The entrance exhaled a cool, mineral-scented breeze that made her fur stand on end.

Shelly finally reached the spot, breathing heavily from her journey around the tree's base. "Well done. The entrance reveals itself only to those with pure intentions." She paused, her small eyes meeting Luna's. "Once we enter, there's no guarantee we'll find our way back the same way. Are you certain about this?"

Luna thought of the barn owl who had struggled to hunt the previous night, and the family of raccoons she'd seen stumbling blindly near the creek. "I'm certain," she said, though her voice quavered slightly.

Without another word, Luna squeezed through the opening. The passage was narrow at first, forcing her to crawl on her belly. The stone walls were smooth and surprisingly warm to the touch. Behind her, she could hear the soft, rhythmic scraping of Shelly's shell against the tunnel floor.

"Your slime trail is glowing," Luna observed, glancing back. Indeed, Shelly's usual clear secretion shimmered with an opalescent light in the cave's darkness.

"Another gift of the full moon," Shelly explained, breathing hard. "It will help us find our way back—if the shadows don't discover it first."

The tunnel gradually widened, allowing Luna to stand and stretch her cramped muscles. The air grew thicker and more humid as they descended. Strange, phosphorescent fungi dotted the walls, providing just enough light to see by. Their blue-green glow cast eerie shadows that seemed to move independently of their creators.

"This place feels... alive," Luna murmured, her ears swiveling at every small sound—the distant drip of water, the whisper of air through unseen passages.

"In a way, it is," Shelly replied. "These caves are older than memory, carved by forces beyond our understanding. They respond to the emotions of those who enter."

As if summoned by her words, the tunnel ahead split into three separate passages. Luna approached the junction cautiously, her nose twitching as she tested the air from each opening. The leftmost passage smelled of stagnant water and decay. The middle path carried a metallic scent that made her teeth ache. But the rightmost tunnel... there was something different about its air—a faint sweetness, like night-blooming jasmine.

"This way," she decided, choosing the right path.

The passage sloped downward more steeply now, and Luna found herself using her claws for purchase on the increasingly slick stone. Her enhanced night vision served her well, allowing her to spot loose rocks and hidden crevices that could trap an unwary paw.

Behind her, Shelly's progress was steady but laborious. Luna found herself stopping frequently to wait, fighting her feline impatience. Each pause made her more aware of the oppressive weight of earth and stone above them, and the growing sense that they were being watched.

The tunnel curved sharply ahead, and Luna noticed that the phosphorescent fungi had begun to fade, leaving longer stretches of absolute darkness between pools of dim light. More unsettling still, the air had begun to whisper—not with wind, but with sounds that were almost like voices, speaking in languages she couldn't understand.

"Shelly," she called softly, "do you hear that?"

But when she turned around, her friend was nowhere to be seen. The glowing slime trail ended abruptly just a few feet behind her, as if Shelly had simply... vanished.

Luna's heart hammered against her ribs as the whispers grew louder, and somewhere in the darkness ahead, something began to laugh.
