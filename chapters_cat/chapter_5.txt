# Chapter 5: The First Light

Luna's paws touched solid earth just as a thunderous crash echoed behind them. The ground trembled, sending ripples through nearby puddles, and dust billowed from the cave entrance like an angry ghost. She turned to see the once-gaping mouth of the Crystal Cave now sealed forever beneath tons of fallen stone.

"Shelly!" Luna called, her heart hammering. "Are you—"

"Here," came a weak voice from beside a moss-covered rock. "Just... catching my breath."

Luna padded over to find her friend's shell gleaming with exhaustion, his eyestalks drooping. But clutched carefully in Shelly's slime trail was their prize—a perfect orb of crystallized moonlight, no larger than Luna's paw, pulsing with gentle silver radiance.

"We did it," Luna whispered, hardly daring to believe it. The moonbeam's glow painted everything around them in ethereal light, making the garden seem magical. "We actually did it."

Shelly's eyestalks perked up slightly. "You were magnificent in there, Luna. I've never seen anything move so fast."

"And I've never seen anyone so brave," Luna replied, gently nudging her friend's shell with her nose. "You saved us both with that slime trail. I couldn't have escaped without you."

For a moment, they sat in comfortable silence, basking in their shared triumph. The moonbeam orb cast dancing shadows through the oak's leaves, and Luna felt a warmth in her chest that had nothing to do with the crystal's glow. This little snail, whom she'd barely noticed before tonight, had become the truest friend she'd ever known.

But as Luna gazed up at the sky, her contentment wavered. The full moon that had started their adventure now hung lower, and its edges seemed less bright than before.

"Shelly," she said carefully, "how many caves did you say there were?"

Shelly followed her gaze upward, his expression growing solemn. "Seven in total. This was just the first."

"Seven?" Luna's tail twitched with nervous energy. "And how long do we have?"

"The moonbeams must all be freed before the next new moon," Shelly explained, his voice heavy with the weight of their task. "Otherwise, the shadow creatures will grow too strong, and the remaining caves will become impenetrable forever."

Luna felt her stomach drop. "How long is that?"

"Two weeks."

The words hung in the air like a challenge. Luna looked at the single precious orb they'd fought so hard to obtain, then at her exhausted friend who had already risked everything for their cause. Seven caves. Six more battles with the shadow creatures. Six more chances for everything to go wrong.

A cool breeze rustled through the oak's branches, and Luna noticed something that made her fur stand on end. Dark clouds were gathering on the horizon, moving fast across the star-scattered sky. The sweet scent of approaching rain filled her nostrils.

"A storm's coming," she observed.

Shelly's eyestalks swiveled toward the approaching weather. "The caves will be more dangerous when it's raining. The shadow creatures grow stronger in darkness, and if we can't see the moon..."

Luna stood up, her green eyes flashing with determination despite the daunting task ahead. She thought of all the nocturnal creatures who depended on their night vision—the wise old owl in the elm tree, the family of raccoons by the creek, even the tiny field mice who scurried through the grass. They were all counting on her and Shelly, whether they knew it or not.

"Then we'd better get started," Luna declared, her voice steady and sure. "Where's the second cave?"

Shelly blinked in surprise, then his expression warmed with admiration and gratitude. "Beyond the rose garden, near the old stone wall. But Luna, are you certain? This is only going to get more dangerous."

Luna looked down at her small friend, then up at the storm clouds racing toward them across the darkening sky. Thunder rumbled in the distance like the growl of some enormous beast.

"I'm certain," she said firmly. "We're in this together."

As the first drops of rain began to fall, Luna carefully picked up the moonbeam orb in her mouth while Shelly began his slow journey toward their next destination. Behind them, the collapsed cave stood as proof of what they'd already accomplished.

Ahead lay six more caves, and six more chances to save the night.
