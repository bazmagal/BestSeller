"""
Main agent that autonomously orchestrates story generation.

The agent has access to two MCP tools:
- generate_plot: Creates a 200-word story plot from themes
- write_chapter: Writes individual chapters to files

The agent autonomously decides how to use these tools to create a complete 3-chapter story.

Usage:
    python main_agent.py "mystery, haunted lighthouse, unreliable narrator"
